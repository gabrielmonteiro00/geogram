This simple web page uses both Google and Instagram API's in order to retrieve recent media content from Instagram, based on the desired location (input).

I follow this video to code this, and did some search in google, because Instagram API has changed since the video was uploaded.

On this two web sites, you can get an Instagram Access token to have a more complete use of API:

I am planning to did some additions to this code any time soon, but that's all for the moment!
